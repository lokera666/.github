# ASSUMPTIONS:
# - We're in the root directory of a working copy of the translation repository.
# - Remote 'english' exists and points at the main Solidity repository.
# - Working copy is clean, with no modified or untracked files.

# Try to merge changes from the main repository. Anything changed at the same time in the translation
# and in the main repo will result in a conflict and will make the command fail. This is fine.
# We want to include the conflict markers as a part of the merge commit so that they're easy to spot in the PR.
# The command will also fail if in the main repo there were modifications to files outside
# of docs/ (these files are deleted in translation repos). These are the conflicts we want to ignore.

    # translation repo but to git they look like files from the main repo that need to be synced.
